# Examples
In this directory are some examples that will showcase how to apply `pypely`. To show different use cases `pypely` can be applied to there are three different types of examples:

* [mnist_training](./mnist_training/): The example is referencing [Arjan Codes YouTube tutorials](https://youtu.be/ka70COItN40), where he takes the codebase of a data science project and refactors it. The project trains a simple torch model on mnist data. The example here provides an alternative implementation using `pypely`. 
* [data_object](./data_objects/): This example is the implementation of the documentation code snippets. It showcases how `pypely` can be used in combination with custom created immutable data objects.
* [preprocessing](.preprocessing/): This example applies the `pypely` approach to different kaggle data preprocessing examples.


> :mailbox: If you find the approaches in the examples interesting but have feedback, criticisms or questions please feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.
